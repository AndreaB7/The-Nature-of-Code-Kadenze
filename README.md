# The-Nature-of-Code-Kadenze

This repo is largely redundant as all of the p5.js examples live in [The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js), however, I am keeping a separate repo for the exact code that accompanies the video tutorials made for that course.  There are minor differences.
